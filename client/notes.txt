ReactDOM is the glue between React and the DOM (Document Object Model)
react-dom package is more for web integration
It literally renders the HTML elements


WHY DO WE USE className instead of class?
Because jsx is transpiled into JavaScript functions, and if you transpile it with 'class', you'll likely run into errors :(

What is the fr unit in CSS?
It stands for fraction (fraction of the available space). That helps us to specify sizes or lenghts relative to the AVAILABLE space in the grid container.
The pixels it actually occupies depend on two things: the 

What is rem? 
It stands for 'roo-em' units, and it dictates an element's font size to the size of the root element.
Keep in mind that is a RELATIVE sizing unit
It just REPRESENTS the font size of the ROOT element.
What does that mean?
1rem is the same as the font size of the HTML element.
This is usually 16px, which is the default value.
Why would we use it?
Because it ensures CONSISTENCY (in terms of font size and spacing).

Difference between rem and em?
em is RELATIVE to the own element.
rem is RELATIVE to the ROOT element

the advantage of rem is that we don't have to pay attention to nestings affecting the font size, whereas with rem we just take the root element as a reference

The pitfall of rem is that the font size might get somewhat difficult to use. Take a look at this reference:

10px = 0.625rem
12px = 0.75rem
14px = 0.875rem
16px = 1rem (base)
18px = 1.125rem
20px = 1.25rem
24px = 1.5rem
30px = 1.875rem
32px = 2rem

Look at this example:
p {
    font-size: 16px; /* 1em = 16px */
}

This one is more insightful

html {
    font-size: 100%; /* 100% = 16px */
}
p {
    font-size: 1em; /* 1em = 16px */
}
h1 {
    font-size: 2em; / 2em = 32px */
}

<time> element in HTML
I didn't know about this one. We can provide it with an attribute that has a machine-readable date
