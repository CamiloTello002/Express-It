<p><em>Express It</em> is a web application built on top of the MERN stack. It has features such as creating your own account and adding images to your account.</p>

<h2>Technologies used</h2>
<ul>
  <li>React.js</li>
  <li>MongoDB</li>
  <li>Express.js</li>
  <li>Node.js</li>
</ul>
The tech stack used for this project was the MERN stack because it provides the necessary tools for building an application like this.Besides, MongoDB doesn't require strict schemas for users and posts models in the database, which makes it quite flexible.
The components philosophy of React.js made it simpler for building the website structure; besides, I was able to modularize the frontend part, which made a good separation of concerns.

<h2>Challenges faced when making this application</h2>
<p>Most of the things I had to deal with were beginner issues such as CORS policies, credentials, alignment of elements in the frontend, deploy</p>
