**Yarn not installing node modules inside the current folder but outside?**
Check if the outer folder has a package.json file. If it does, then you can remove it and try to install the packages inside the api folder

I recapped something: when you call the model method, you must do it with the first letter in lowercase (model instead of Model)

I did recap a lot of things :0

YARN stands for Yet Another Resource Navigator


**PASWORD SALTING**
reference:https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/definition/salt#:~:text=With%20password%20salting%2C%20a%20random,when%20the%20users%20enter%20them.
Salting is a technique that consists of adding 32 or more characters to the password BEFORE hashing it
This avoids hackers from reverse-engineering passwords
Process:
when a user logs in, the passwords runs through a one-way hashing algorithm. This string is compared to the other hashes ALREADY STORED in the website's database

There's one problem: if two passwords are the same, then the hash resulting from them ends up being identical
But the salting adds RANDOM characters to each passwords, making them UNIQUE
this prevents us from three threats:
- brute-force attacks (hackers try every combination)
- dictionary attacks (try the most common combinations)
- rainbow table attacks (pre-computed database of decrypted hash passwords)
